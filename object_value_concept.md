# Object Value
## _What is a object value?_

A object value is a class without identification but defined by the complet set of his values, this class just represent a value, scaping of the rules of domain and with this, making more clean the objective of domain.
In [Martin Fowler blogs](https://martinfowler.com), his mentions one rule of obj. values
>  **Value objects should be immutable**

If we want change the value of the object, is necessary create a new obj.
With object values we can build a tier in our aplication, above the domain, how the only objective is helping to make the domain proprieties more specific.
